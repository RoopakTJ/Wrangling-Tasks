It does this by introducing students to the main paradigms (including the importance of an African paradigm) and theories of crime and critically evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of those paradigms and theories. It also analyses issues such as: What is crime? How does society decide that certain actions are criminal? What are the causes of crime? The seriousness of the crime problem; why society views corporate crime differently from street crime; how the media responds to crime; the value or otherwise of crime statistics and what effect the images of crime have on societies' perceptions of the crime problem and how it should be addressed.",

Ethical/legal issues relevant to professional responsibility, the doctor-patient relationship and public accountability link directly to future clinical practice. Students acquire skills in basic research, including data management and critical appraisal of evidence and knowledge which provide the basis for evidence based clinical decision-making.  Scientific basis of clinical practice aims to provide students with detailed knowledge of selected body systems in health and disease.  In the clinical skills component of the curriculum, students are expected to draw upon theoretic knowledge, and apply this during the development clinical reasoning, and the performance of key clinical skills tasks. An integral component of this unit is the weekly problem based learning activity (PBL). Each PBL integrates content presented to students across the four themes throughout the week.",

Older interpretations have been integrated with bold, new insights into a grand scenario of a dynamic planet 'on the move'.   Continents break apart and reassemble; ocean floors open up and deepen into grand basins; volcanoes blow their tops; and even huge mountains systems rise up from originally quiet seas, a seemingly perpetual pageant of dynamic geologic processes. By studying and surveying global basins and their diverse infill of sediments and associated fossils, we can piece together the grand geologic puzzle through the ages.  Fossil remains assist greatly in reconstructing ancient global continental connections, environments and climate, punctuated by global catastrophes to arrive at a picture of the evolution of life through time.  This 'big picture science' is accomplished by diverse disciplines, including tectonics, sedimentology, stratigraphy, paleontology, geophysics, and field work, the latter of which is a significant skills set for the geologist.   Ultimately, we endeavour to reconstruct our great earth jigsaw through the ages and in the modern age use the rock record of basins for global energy needs (i.e., water, oil, gas, and coal). In doing so, we enrich humanity by peering into unfamiliar and previously unknown ancient environments around the globe and by supplying important resources.",

Is it my mind, or my mind and my body? Can I ever have knowledge of anything outside the self? How do I know that I am not dreaming all my sensory experiences of the physical world? Or how do I know that I am not being deceived into thinking that the external world exists?

This unit is a practice driven, workshop based unit which explores varied drawing methodologies and ways they can contribute to a research practice in visual culture. It is designed to develop, challenge and expand how students think about making artwork and to develop research skills. A series of individual and collaborative exercises and projects are presented as starting points that, when navigated, foster creative research skills and develop students' material skills. The main emphasis of this class is to demonstrate how thinking operates through making. Fabrication processes in the workshop can be in any medium from across two- and/or three-dimensional works, to sound and performance. The aim of these exercises is to have a generative influence on production, creating a pool of ideas, strategies, forms and processes for students to draw on and develop as they progress through the course. Teaching methodology involves critical dialogue, classroom discussion and peer review. This unit presents a broad range of approaches to contemporary art and its institutions for those wishing to work in the arts industry as artists, curators, arts writers, educators or practitioners. Research Practices encourages an experimental approach to conceptual and material outcomes. Safe and sustainable approaches to fabrication and materials are core values in the unit.",

The unit covers topics across multidisciplinary fields of study and diverse social-cultural contexts, such as: bodily integrity, gender-based violence, genders and sexualities, HIV and AIDS and reproductive justice. The unit also explores the cross-cutting nature of SRHR in less researched areas of concern, such as, poverty, food sovereignty, security and disaster, climate justice, labour and migration and political and religious fundamentalisms.",

We will consider this question by looking at a variety of case studies, including the American Civil War, the creation of unified states in Italy and Germany, the struggle for nationhood in the face of Western imperialism in East Asia, and the founding myth of Australian nationalism at Gallipoli. Emphasizing connections and commonalities between societies geographically apart and culturally different, the course seeks to understand the global processes that led to the forging of nations and nationalisms through wars and revolutions.",

The unit will start with a discussion on the basics of probability theory, time series analysis, stochastic models and multivariate data (pattern) analysis.  It will then focus on the principles of decision making in statistical analysis (significance tests), which is followed by a discussion of the pitfalls and general strategies in statistical analysis.  The unit will not focus on deriving statistical parameters, but rather will emphasise how these methods can be applied and will discuss the potential pitfalls in interpreting statistical results.",

We study the remains of houses, palaces, temples, pottery, tools, weapons, statues, and paintings, and we think about what they can tell us about the way communities organized their societies. We also incorporate the information we learn from written texts as well as from oral histories. Topics include human evolution, origins of farming, the growth of cities, the development of writing, the pyramids of Egypt, the complex societies of the Indus Valley, the Mycenaean kingdoms, and the fall of Troy.

The unit is designed to help you systematically analyse the various channel functions and strategies. Mastering the principles that will be discussed in this unit will also help you in understanding Supply Chain issues. It is important to note however, that this unit is NOT about supply chain management but rather about the role of channels as a marketing strategic element. Some topics of supply chain management of course will be discussed from a marketing perspective. In order to better understand the theory in the context of the business world actual business cases are used throughout the lectures and tutorials.",

This unit explores the experience of Australians at war - both overseas and on the home front - from confrontations between indigenous Australians and European settlers on the colonial frontier through the major conflicts of the twentieth century, with a particular focus on the two World Wars. We examine the 'face of battle' and how war affected men and women on the front line (including indigenous servicemen), and we consider how war was experienced on the home front and reshaped Australian society. We explore the contested creation of an 'Anzac legend' and how war challenged and consolidated social relations and national identities. Students will undertake hands-on research using the rich primary source record of Australians at war, including service records, diaries and letters, oral histories, photographs and repatriation files that illuminate the impact of war on veterans, their families, and their communities.",

This is the question that sparks our journey through French culture in this unit. With concrete examples and clear case-studies we will walk in the shoes of film-makers, writers, artists and thinkers as they wrestle with questions of truth and meaning in the rapidly changing twentieth century world, questions that have all-too immediate implications: How should I live my life in a world without certainties? What, if anything, gives my life meaning? And what is left worth fighting for, living for, dying for?",

Students are introduced to the healthcare system and a range of health care settings via an introductory clinical placement. This aims to commence the application of the nutrition care process, the use of food as a therapeutic tool, clinical reasoning, reflection and advanced communication and interpersonal skills required for dietetic practice. Attendance at this placement is compulsory. This unit supports students' progression towards entry level competencies in individual case management in the healthcare setting.

Through an exploration of basic rhetorical principles and developmental patterns of a range of academic literacy forms, emphasis is given to the discourse practices and research skills necessary for disciplinary expertise. Underpinning the development of these key skills is the recognition that   students need to be enabled to participate in academic discourses as active contributors to knowledge construction, contestation, application and communication, and not mere recipients. Lectures will focus on key areas of academic literacies while exploring differences or similarities between perspectives and genres in the various disciplines.   By engaging in the rigorous academic process of critical reading, writing, revision, presentation, and discussion together with academic support and feedback, tutorials enable students to gradually participate in the construction, debate and interrogation of academic knowledge.",

It then shows how Italian political thinkers shaped the competing ideologies at the heart of twentieth century Europe's crises & revolutions: Liberalism, Marxism and Fascism.  It will focus on one of Prato's most famous citizens, political theorist, diplomat, journalist, novelist and director Curzio Malaparte, whose life and work is a microcosm of these ideological disputes. It takes students to the present day by studying the rise and fall of Italy's First Republic (1948-1992) and its consensus democracy; the birth of the Second Republic (1992-), with its hopes for rebuilding Italian democratic institutions and civic culture in the context of endemic political corruption; and the recent emergence of Italian populist, anti-European Union movements.",

Considering crime and criminal justice through a settler-colonial lens, students will learn from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voices about experiences of crime and criminal justice, emerging trends in Indigenous justice and consider ways to improve and 'decolonise' current forms of criminal justice. Drawing upon Indigenous perspectives and critical inter-disciplinary work, students will examine topics such as: Indigenous customary law, the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, mandatory sentencing practices, and the policing of public space, language in court systems and Koori courts.",

Students undertake an individual self-guided learning task in the form of a research project. The project topic must be in a significantly different mining area to the topic chosen in MNE4050. Greater depth is expected in the investigation of the topic compared to MNE4050 since the basic research skills have already been developed previously. However, the depth expected is less than that required in the full year single project topic completed as MNE4050 and MNE4070 together.

Students will explore a range of strategies for experimenting with forms and with themes through a series of reading materials (short stories, excerpts from longer works, poetry, etc.) and writing exercises that are contextualised in varied social-political and cultural contexts. The major composition that is built on weekly exercises has a thematic focus that is student-driven and demonstrates the processes of researching, drafting and editing creative texts. The unit is oriented towards practical and critical application of advanced experimental strategies in creative writing so that students can better appreciate the extent of originality of style and content of their work in relation to that of published authors. Equally important is the appreciation of what these strategies aim to achieve both aesthetically and ideologically, and the pros and cons of their engagement. Finally, the unit is also oriented towards the production of effective and experimental writing, and the importance of reflecting on creative work through the critical techniques of exegesis.",

By visiting the city through literature and film students will be exposed to a diversity of texts, written and visual, that grapple with the complexity of urban spaces and with challenges posed to Italian cities by increased migration. In addition to considering textual representations of urban spaces, a particular focus of the unit will be the urban biography of Prato, from the Middle Ages to the present day. This will include examining how Prato's remarkable economic history has contributed to its distinctive civic identity, and how the culture of the city is reflected in contemporary writings.",

We will examine various approaches in anthropology to drug use, including the symbolism of drugs, ritual behaviours, economic and political factors influencing the use, production and distribution of drugs and the way in which these processes are enmeshed in local cultures and social networks and the global political economy.  The unit will explore how patterns of drug use as well as dispositions towards use differ across cultural and social borders. Topics include: anthropological approaches to drugs as substances of value, power and desire; ethnomedicine and shamanism, bioprospecting and the trade in herbal medicines;  international traffic in drugs and its relationship to  regional politics and local tribal, peasant and commercial systems of production and exchange; drug  tourism; youth culture and drugs in the West; cultures of intravenous drug use;  the global political economy of pharmaceuticals,  clinical drug trials; antimicrobial resistance, the anthropology of contraceptives, erectile dysfunction drugs; anti-retrovirals in the age of AIDS; Australian and Pacific indigenous drug use; drug trafficking on the internet.",

Older interpretations have been integrated with bold, new insights into a grand scenario of a dynamic planet 'on the move'.   Continents break apart and reassemble; ocean floors open up and deepen into grand basins; volcanoes blow their tops; and even huge mountains systems rise up from originally quiet seas, a seemingly perpetual pageant of dynamic geologic processes. By studying and surveying global basins and their diverse infill of sediments and associated fossils, we can piece together the grand geologic puzzle through the ages.  Fossil remains assist greatly in reconstructing ancient global continental connections, environments and climate, punctuated by global catastrophes to arrive at a picture of the evolution of life through time.  This 'big picture science' is accomplished by diverse disciplines, including tectonics, sedimentology, stratigraphy, paleontology, geophysics, and field work, the latter of which is a significant skills set for the geologist.   Ultimately, we endeavour to reconstruct our great earth jigsaw through the ages and in the modern age use the rock record of basins for global energy needs (i.e., water, oil, gas, and coal). In doing so, we enrich humanity by peering into unfamiliar and previously unknown ancient environments around the globe and by supplying important resources.",

In this unit emphasis is placed on independent cultural research and its relation to a broader collaborative or group context in the public realm. Students develop a creative, expressive and critical project that utilises advanced conceptualisation and material manipulation, engaging with the artwork as part of a chain of production, reception, distribution and publics. Students develop individual programs in conjunction with the lecturers that reflect their evolving cultural practice and professional direction. The program focuses on clear articulation of concepts and their publication in the written form as a supplement to the student's Visual Practice. Detailed analysis and discussion of students' work takes place primarily through personal tuition with lecturers, peer-based critique and experimenting with various modes of public presentation. This unit provides a stimulating and supportive environment through the introduction of a supervised studio and bridges this to independent professional practice in the broader arts arena. This unit contextualises individual practice within various public platforms that require different modes of group and/or collaborative modes of engagement. The work produced culminates in an end of year exhibition of a professional standard, preparing students for entry into the professional world as cultural producer in broad array of Visual Arts disciplines, or the pursuit of further studies at a higher level.",

It then considers the role of microorganisms in biogeochemical nutrient cycles. Some important natural habitats for microorganisms such as air, fresh water and salt water are considered with the main discussion centred on soil. The roles of particular soil microorganisms within their microenvironments are explained with special attention being given to microorganisms involved in transformations of carbon and nitrogen. The role of microorganisms in composting, the management of pollution and as agents of bioremediation is discussed.",
