<title> Explaining crime: Theory and practice</title>
<synopsis> The unit is designed to help students understand crime and to be able to critically analyse and evaluate the various facets of crime. It does this by introducing students to the main paradigms (including the importance of an African paradigm) and theories of crime and critically evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of those paradigms and theories. It also analyses issues such as: What is crime? How does society decide that certain actions are criminal? What are the causes of crime? The seriousness of the crime problem; why society views corporate crime differently from street crime; how the media responds to crime; the value or otherwise of crime statistics and what effect the images of crime have on societies' perceptions of the crime problem and how it should be addressed.</synopsis>

<title> Medicine 3</title>
<synopsis> Through the theme based curriculum, this unit continues to provide integrated studies that build the foundations for commencing studies in clinical settings.  A deeper understanding of the socio-economic context of health and illness, awareness of the non-medical services which support the practice of medicine, and improved health outcomes is developed.  Ethical/legal issues relevant to professional responsibility, the doctor-patient relationship and public accountability link directly to future clinical practice. Students acquire skills in basic research, including data management and critical appraisal of evidence and knowledge which provide the basis for evidence based clinical decision-making.  Scientific basis of clinical practice aims to provide students with detailed knowledge of selected body systems in health and disease.  In the clinical skills component of the curriculum, students are expected to draw upon theoretic knowledge, and apply this during the development clinical reasoning, and the performance of key clinical skills tasks. An integral component of this unit is the weekly problem based learning activity (PBL). Each PBL integrates content presented to students across the four themes throughout the week.</synopsis>

<title> Sediments and basins</title>
<synopsis> Geologists study our Earth by digging through millions (and even billions) of years into the 'deep time' past.  Older interpretations have been integrated with bold, new insights into a grand scenario of a dynamic planet 'on the move'.   Continents break apart and reassemble; ocean floors open up and deepen into grand basins; volcanoes blow their tops; and even huge mountains systems rise up from originally quiet seas, a seemingly perpetual pageant of dynamic geologic processes. By studying and surveying global basins and their diverse infill of sediments and associated fossils, we can piece together the grand geologic puzzle through the ages.  Fossil remains assist greatly in reconstructing ancient global continental connections, environments and climate, punctuated by global catastrophes to arrive at a picture of the evolution of life through time.  This 'big picture science' is accomplished by diverse disciplines, including tectonics, sedimentology, stratigraphy, paleontology, geophysics, and field work, the latter of which is a significant skills set for the geologist.   Ultimately, we endeavour to reconstruct our great earth jigsaw through the ages and in the modern age use the rock record of basins for global energy needs (i.e., water, oil, gas, and coal). In doing so, we enrich humanity by peering into unfamiliar and previously unknown ancient environments around the globe and by supplying important resources.</synopsis>

<title> History of philosophy: Descartes</title>
<synopsis> Seventeenth-century philosopher Rene Descartes famously declared that 'I think therefore I am' or that 'I am, I exist, is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind'. His discussion of what this insight entails has set the agenda for modern philosophical debates in epistemology and metaphysics. Some of the questions he proposed include: what is the self? Is it my mind, or my mind and my body? Can I ever have knowledge of anything outside the self? How do I know that I am not dreaming all my sensory experiences of the physical world? Or how do I know that I am not being deceived into thinking that the external world exists?

<title> Research practices</title>
<synopsis> Research Practices is a core unit in the Visual Arts sequence and is one of four first year units. This unit is a practice driven, workshop based unit which explores varied drawing methodologies and ways they can contribute to a research practice in visual culture. It is designed to develop, challenge and expand how students think about making artwork and to develop research skills. A series of individual and collaborative exercises and projects are presented as starting points that, when navigated, foster creative research skills and develop students' material skills. The main emphasis of this class is to demonstrate how thinking operates through making. Fabrication processes in the workshop can be in any medium from across two- and/or three-dimensional works, to sound and performance. The aim of these exercises is to have a generative influence on production, creating a pool of ideas, strategies, forms and processes for students to draw on and develop as they progress through the course. Teaching methodology involves critical dialogue, classroom discussion and peer review. This unit presents a broad range of approaches to contemporary art and its institutions for those wishing to work in the arts industry as artists, curators, arts writers, educators or practitioners. Research Practices encourages an experimental approach to conceptual and material outcomes. Safe and sustainable approaches to fabrication and materials are core values in the unit.</synopsis>

<title> Modelling for data analysis</title>
<synopsis> This unit explores the statistical modelling foundations that underlie the analytic aspects of Data Science. Motivated by case studies and working through examples, this unit covers the mathematical and statistical basis with an emphasis on using the techniques in practice. It introduces data collection, sampling and quality. It considers analytic tasks such as statistical hypothesis testing and exploratory versus confirmatory analysis. It presents basic probability distributions, random number generation and simulation as well as estimation methods and effects such as maximum likelihood estimators, Monte Carlo estimators, Bayes theorem, bias versus variance and cross validation. Basic information theory and dependence models such as regression and log-linear models are also presented, as well as the role of general modelling such as inference and decision making, and predictive models.</synopsis>

<title> Introducing archaeology 1</title>
<synopsis> Archaeology is the study of the material culture (the things) that remain from past communities. In this unit we show you how we recover those remains through archaeological research, and how we can use them to understand the past and its relevance to the present. We examine the cultures of the Mediterranean world (Egypt, Mesopotamia, Anatolia, Iran, and Greece) Asia and Australasia and focus on the period before 1000 BCE. We study the remains of houses, palaces, temples, pottery, tools, weapons, statues, and paintings, and we think about what they can tell us about the way communities organized their societies. We also incorporate the information we learn from written texts as well as from oral histories. Topics include human evolution, origins of farming, the growth of cities, the development of writing, the pyramids of Egypt, the complex societies of the Indus Valley, the Mycenaean kingdoms, and the fall of Troy. Hands-on tutorials explore the archaeological methods used to reconstruct ancient societies.</synopsis>

<title> Marketing channels</title>
<synopsis> The marketing task is not complete until customers receive their goods. Distribution is the process that makes that happen. The primary aim of this unit is the development and management of distribution channels in order to meet your marketing objectives. The unit is designed to help you systematically analyse the various channel functions and strategies. Mastering the principles that will be discussed in this unit will also help you in understanding Supply Chain issues. It is important to note however, that this unit is NOT about supply chain management but rather about the role of channels as a marketing strategic element. Some topics of supply chain management of course will be discussed from a marketing perspective. In order to better understand the theory in the context of the business world actual business cases are used throughout the lectures and tutorials.</synopsis>

<title> Australians at war</title>
<synopsis> How has war shaped Australians and Australian society and why has war become central to national mythology and identity? This unit explores the experience of Australians at war - both overseas and on the home front - from confrontations between indigenous Australians and European settlers on the colonial frontier through the major conflicts of the twentieth century, with a particular focus on the two World Wars. We examine the 'face of battle' and how war affected men and women on the front line (including indigenous servicemen), and we consider how war was experienced on the home front and reshaped Australian society. We explore the contested creation of an 'Anzac legend' and how war challenged and consolidated social relations and national identities. Students will undertake hands-on research using the rich primary source record of Australians at war, including service records, diaries and letters, oral histories, photographs and repatriation files that illuminate the impact of war on veterans, their families, and their communities.</synopsis>

<synopsis> Many people today say there is no one 'truth' that holds for all people in all places at all times, or that none of us can really be sure of life's 'meaning' in an absolute sense. But just a century ago the story would have been very different. So what happened between our great grandparents' generation and ours to revolutionise the way we think about truth and meaning? This is the question that sparks our journey through French culture in this unit. With concrete examples and clear case-studies we will walk in the shoes of film-makers, writers, artists and thinkers as they wrestle with questions of truth and meaning in the rapidly changing twentieth century world, questions that have all-too immediate implications: How should I live my life in a world without certainties? What, if anything, gives my life meaning? And what is left worth fighting for, living for, dying for?</synopsis>

<title> Academic literacies</title>
<synopsis> This unit draws from various disciplines to contextualise students' development of discipline-specific skills and approaches to knowledge construction and interrogation essential for successful study at university.  It examines and develops reading, writing, thinking, communication and research skills through discipline-specific perspectives in the sciences, humanities and social sciences.  Through an exploration of basic rhetorical principles and developmental patterns of a range of academic literacy forms, emphasis is given to the discourse practices and research skills necessary for disciplinary expertise. Underpinning the development of these key skills is the recognition that   students need to be enabled to participate in academic discourses as active contributors to knowledge construction, contestation, application and communication, and not mere recipients. Lectures will focus on key areas of academic literacies while exploring differences or similarities between perspectives and genres in the various disciplines.   By engaging in the rigorous academic process of critical reading, writing, revision, presentation, and discussion together with academic support and feedback, tutorials enable students to gradually participate in the construction, debate and interrogation of academic knowledge.</synopsis>

<title> Modern Italian political thought</title>
<synopsis> The unit surveys Italian political thought &#38; practice from the Renaissance to the New Millennium. It aims to give students a clear understanding of modern &#38; contemporary Italian political ideas, culture and institutions. It begins by examining Italian political thinkers, diplomats, and activists' seminal contribution to Renaissance, Enlightenment and Modern political theories and movements. It then shows how Italian political thinkers shaped the competing ideologies at the heart of twentieth century Europe's crises &#38; revolutions: Liberalism, Marxism and Fascism.  It will focus on one of Prato's most famous citizens, political theorist, diplomat, journalist, novelist and director Curzio Malaparte, whose life and work is a microcosm of these ideological disputes. It takes students to the present day by studying the rise and fall of Italy's First Republic (1948-1992) and its consensus democracy; the birth of the Second Republic (1992-), with its hopes for rebuilding Italian democratic institutions and civic culture in the context of endemic political corruption; and the recent emergence of Italian populist, anti-European Union movements.</synopsis>

<title> Indigenous justice in Australia</title>
<synopsis> The unit introduces students to issues of Indigenous justice and injustice in Australia. This unit focuses on critically understanding the relationship between colonialism in Australia, Indigenous Law and systems of justice and contemporary concerns of injustice. By understanding the role of the criminal justice system in histories of Australian colonialism, students will learn how the criminal justice system has attempted to manage Aboriginal people from the European settlement into the present. Considering crime and criminal justice through a settler-colonial lens, students will learn from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voices about experiences of crime and criminal justice, emerging trends in Indigenous justice and consider ways to improve and 'decolonise' current forms of criminal justice. Drawing upon Indigenous perspectives and critical inter-disciplinary work, students will examine topics such as: Indigenous customary law, the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, mandatory sentencing practices, and the policing of public space, language in court systems and Koori courts.</synopsis>

Greater depth is expected in the investigation of the topic compared to MNE4050 since the basic research skills have already been developed previously.

<title> Strategies in writing experiments</title>
<synopsis> The unit approaches creative writing in terms of its status as a product of processes of experimentation (as distinct from personal expression). Students will explore a range of strategies for experimenting with forms and with themes through a series of reading materials (short stories, excerpts from longer works, poetry, etc.) and writing exercises that are contextualised in varied social-political and cultural contexts. The major composition that is built on weekly exercises has a thematic focus that is student-driven and demonstrates the processes of researching, drafting and editing creative texts. The unit is oriented towards practical and critical application of advanced experimental strategies in creative writing so that students can better appreciate the extent of originality of style and content of their work in relation to that of published authors. Equally important is the appreciation of what these strategies aim to achieve both aesthetically and ideologically, and the pros and cons of their engagement. Finally, the unit is also oriented towards the production of effective and experimental writing, and the importance of reflecting on creative work through the critical techniques of exegesis.</synopsis>

<title> Process control</title>
<synopsis> This unit provides a thorough introduction to process control and simulation. The unit begins with understanding disturbances, why disturbances need to be controlled and possible responses of various systems to a disturbance. The selection of which variables to control, which variables to manipulate and approaches to interactions are covered, together with the most important types of control loops and computer control systems. Topics include common control scenarios - feed back, feed forward, and cascade systems; ratio control; tuning of PID controllers; single loop and multiple loop systems;  interactions and decoupling; process simulation and advanced process control.</synopsis>

<title> The Italian city: Historical and literary perspectives</title>
<synopsis> The Italian city, a microcosm of Italian society, reveals the rich layers of Italian culture and history. This unit explores Italian cityscapes through their monuments and art works and their representation in literature and film. It offers a journey through the social spaces of the modern city to the virtual zones of the postmodern city. By visiting the city through literature and film students will be exposed to a diversity of texts, written and visual, that grapple with the complexity of urban spaces and with challenges posed to Italian cities by increased migration. In addition to considering textual representations of urban spaces, a particular focus of the unit will be the urban biography of Prato, from the Middle Ages to the present day. This will include examining how Prato's remarkable economic history has contributed to its distinctive civic identity, and how the culture of the city is reflected in contemporary writings.</synopsis>

<title> Drug cultures</title>
<synopsis> Using anthropological and ethnographic studies, this unit focuses on the social and cultural contexts of legal and illegal drug use.  In doing so it highlights the unique approaches and contribution of anthropology as a discipline to understanding behaviour.  We will examine various approaches in anthropology to drug use, including the symbolism of drugs, ritual behaviours, economic and political factors influencing the use, production and distribution of drugs and the way in which these processes are enmeshed in local cultures and social networks and the global political economy.  The unit will explore how patterns of drug use as well as dispositions towards use differ across cultural and social borders. Topics include: anthropological approaches to drugs as substances of value, power and desire; ethnomedicine and shamanism, bioprospecting and the trade in herbal medicines;  international traffic in drugs and its relationship to  regional politics and local tribal, peasant and commercial systems of production and exchange; drug  tourism; youth culture and drugs in the West; cultures of intravenous drug use;  the global political economy of pharmaceuticals,  clinical drug trials; antimicrobial resistance, the anthropology of contraceptives, erectile dysfunction drugs; anti-retrovirals in the age of AIDS; Australian and Pacific indigenous drug use; drug trafficking on the internet.</synopsis>

It considers both external and internal reporting aspects of corporate social and environmental sustainability, and the ways in which such information can be incorporated into decisions made within the entity. The implications of such information for the assurance function are also explored.</synopsis>

<title> Research for design</title>
<synopsis> This unit develops the capacity to understand and apply the methodologies of current design research practice. Through using research processes appropriate to their discipline, students will investigate contemporary issues that penetrate the links between design, society and the environment. They will be required to use their research to uncover existing knowledge; use it to articulate and substantiate an argument; and build on it to formulate their own critically informed ideas. Through acquired research skills students will be able to interrogate a range of contemporary design issues drawn from the perceived moral dichotomies of design: useful/useless, social conscience/private indulgence, essential need/unnecessary consumption, luxury/necessity, and so on.</synopsis>

<title> Sediments and basins</title>
<synopsis> Geologists study our Earth by digging through millions (and even billions) of years into the 'deep time' past.  Older interpretations have been integrated with bold, new insights into a grand scenario of a dynamic planet 'on the move'.   Continents break apart and reassemble; ocean floors open up and deepen into grand basins; volcanoes blow their tops; and even huge mountains systems rise up from originally quiet seas, a seemingly perpetual pageant of dynamic geologic processes. By studying and surveying global basins and their diverse infill of sediments and associated fossils, we can piece together the grand geologic puzzle through the ages.  Fossil remains assist greatly in reconstructing ancient global continental connections, environments and climate, punctuated by global catastrophes to arrive at a picture of the evolution of life through time.  This 'big picture science' is accomplished by diverse disciplines, including tectonics, sedimentology, stratigraphy, paleontology, geophysics, and field work, the latter of which is a significant skills set for the geologist.   Ultimately, we endeavour to reconstruct our great earth jigsaw through the ages and in the modern age use the rock record of basins for global energy needs (i.e., water, oil, gas, and coal). In doing so, we enrich humanity by peering into unfamiliar and previously unknown ancient environments around the globe and by supplying important resources.</synopsis>

<title> Visual practices 3</title>
<synopsis> This unit is the last and culminating unit in the Visual Practices sequence and is second of the two third year units. In this unit emphasis is placed on independent cultural research and its relation to a broader collaborative or group context in the public realm. Students develop a creative, expressive and critical project that utilises advanced conceptualisation and material manipulation, engaging with the artwork as part of a chain of production, reception, distribution and publics. Students develop individual programs in conjunction with the lecturers that reflect their evolving cultural practice and professional direction. The program focuses on clear articulation of concepts and their publication in the written form as a supplement to the student's Visual Practice. Detailed analysis and discussion of students' work takes place primarily through personal tuition with lecturers, peer-based critique and experimenting with various modes of public presentation. This unit provides a stimulating and supportive environment through the introduction of a supervised studio and bridges this to independent professional practice in the broader arts arena. This unit contextualises individual practice within various public platforms that require different modes of group and/or collaborative modes of engagement. The work produced culminates in an end of year exhibition of a professional standard, preparing students for entry into the professional world as cultural producer in broad array of Visual Arts disciplines, or the pursuit of further studies at a higher level.</synopsis>

<title> Environmental governance and citizenship</title>
<synopsis> This unit explores social and institutional frameworks for environmental governance. It considers the role, structure and processes of government, market and civil society in relation to the environment and sustainability agenda. The emphasis is on exploring the nature of contemporary environmental governance, evaluating the assumptions on which it is based, and taking a critically informed view of its strengths and limitations. We will feature case studies e.g. waste management, climate change, water management, where multiple agencies and organisations work within a complex environmental system to implement a range of interesting and innovative approaches to environmental governance.</synopsis>

<title> Public and primary health care in midwifery</title>
<synopsis> This unit introduces students to the interrelationship of midwifery practice, maternity care and public health. The impact of maternity care on maternal and infant health will be discussed within the context of its social determinants. The role of midwifery and maternity care in improving perinatal outcomes for disadvantaged women and families will be discussed and debated. Against these factors the role of midwifery as primary health care will be explored in relation to health promotion and education in pregnancy, birth, parenting and lactation, and fertility regulation.
